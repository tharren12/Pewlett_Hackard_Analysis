# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project involved two primary assignments. The first assignment is to determine the number of retiring employees per job title, with retiring being defined as employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. The second assignment is to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, with eligibility based on whether the employee was born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Resources

* Data Source: Various .csv Employee and HR files

## Pyber Analysis Summary

The following summary are three potential action items that could be undertaken to address the most signifcant disparities between the city types.

1. Put more marketing dollars into Rural and Suburban cities in order to drive more rides, drivers and total fares.
2. Additionally, with more volume going into Rural and Suburban cities there will be increased profits due to higher average fares per ride and driver. Likely, the averages will come down slightly but can return a greater benefit per marketing dollar spent.
3. Incent Urban city drivers to drive in Rural and Suburban cities if possible as there are significantly more drivers in Urban cities and could help to boost demand in underserved cities.
